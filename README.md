Q1 steps : 

Step 1 - Created a repository name: git_assignment_HeroVired

Step 2 - Created a ‘dev’ branch and added the provided python code into the branch as 'CalculatorPlus.py'.

Step 3 - Merged 'dev' branch with the 'main' branch and made a release of 'Version 1' of the ‘calculator plus app’.

Step 4 - Added Prerna (classmate) as collaborator.

Step 5 - Implemented a feature by creating a new branch called ‘feature/sqrt’ and added the ‘sqrt’ code to it.

Step 6 - As per the instruction in step g, switched back to dev branch and then added divide by 0 code fix, while keeping the 'feature/sqrt' branch up-to-date.

Step 7 - After this, ensured the code is running properly for both previous implementations and the newly added feature, along with bug fix, created a pull request for main branch.

Step 8 - Asked Prerna, as a code reviewer to review the PR and then merge into main.

Step 9 - After PR merge, merged the 'feature/sqrt' branch to 'dev'.

Step 10 - Did the final testing of code in 'dev' branch and raised the PR for main, as 'Version 2' release.
